    <h1>How Can I Help</h1>
    <h4>What is wildlife trafficking?</h4>
    <p>Wildlife trafficking includes the poaching of endangered species and illegally trading in wild animals and their parts or products related to them. The illegal wildlife trade was estimated to be a $7-23 billion dollar business according to UN in 2016.</p>
    <h4>Why is it a problem?</h4>
    <p>Wildlife trafficking has many serious implications for humanity and our environment. It pushes tens of tens of thousands of species of animals and plants to the brink of extinction – both directly and indirectly, by killing animals or destroying habitats and food chains by removing species from it. It fuels a multi-billion-dollar criminal industry which results in exploitation of humans as well as environmental resources and is tied into other criminal activities. Illegal wildlife trade also increases the possibility of outbreaks of diseases – in fact the COVID-19 pandemic is suspected to be a result of illegal trading of wildlife.</p>
    <p>You might think that the problem is localised to countries with exotic animal populations but as a matter of fact virtually all countries are involved, both as buyers or sources.</p>
    <h4>How can I help?</h4>
    <p>You can help the cause by donating to charities engaged in protecting wildlife from poaching and trafficking as well as making more informed and ethical choices in your purchase decisions.</p>
    <h4>How can I help if I use EtikBuy?</h4>
    <p>EtikBuy helps you identify products and alternatives with eco-conscious and animal friendly practices.</p>
    <p>Many mainstream companies deliberately or unknowingly contribute to illegal wildlife trafficking through unethical practices. You can help by being more conscious in your choices when buying cosmetic products, clothes, accessories or even medicine and avoiding companies whose practices directly or indirectly cause harm to animals or their habitats or encourage criminal activities in their supply chain. The EtikBuy rating system was developed to help show you how products and companies perform in these areas.</p>
    <p>EtikBuy donates all proceeds from our webshop to our partner charity WWF to directly have a positive impact and help the fight against the wildlife trafficking industry.</p>
